## Introduction

WaniGraphi is a web tool designed for visualizing the dependencies between Japanese language items presented by
[WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com). It is planned that WaniGraphi will eventually allow users to add their own 
language items (such as sentences made using WaniKani vocabulary) and link them to the existing items.
